            Like us, the lives of stray animals have also been affected during the pandemic. Most animals on the streets
            depend on humans around them for sustenance. While many people volunteer as part of organisations or on a
            personal level to feed stray animals...

            I need help for feeding street dogs please donate and help us.
            we would like to highlight  few committed volunteers are involved in feeding stray animals
            since the start of lockdown in some parts of our area. The reason we started this campaign as everyone is
            thinking of human beings one way or the other and most of them are able to contain their hunger, however few
            of them usually think of these helpless canines.

        <p> Each of us can help work towards a day when every animal can have a loving, permanent home by having our
            animal companions spayed or neutered and by always adopting animals and donating to our charity . And
            encourage everyone you know to do the same! It’s also important to consider whether we’re prepared to take
            on the lifelong commitment of caring for an animal before adding a new member to the family.
